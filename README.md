## Project Requirements

### Content

My portfolio site showcases a clean and professional design, with a focus on simplicity and functionality. The site includes a profile picture to give a personal touch, a detailed biography to provide insight into my background and skills, and a functional contact form for easy communication. The "Projects" section I left it as coming soon I will update them once my projects are ready during or after my course, while links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles offer further exploration of my professional presence.

- [x] At least one profile picture
- [x] Biography (at least 100 words)
- [x] Functional Contact Form
- [x] "Projects" section
- [x] Links to external sites, e.g. GitHub and LinkedIn.
  ​

### Technical

The portfolio site incorporates several technical features designed to ensure functionality and maintainability. It includes at least two web pages—a homepage and a projects page—providing a clear separation of content. Version control is managed using Git, which helps track changes and maintain a comprehensive code history. The site is deployed on GitHub Pages, ensuring easy access and reliable performance. While responsive design principles are not implemented, semantic HTML is utilized, as indicated by the use of standard HTML5 elements, which supports a well-structured and accessible layout.

- [x] At least 2 web pages.
- [x] Version controlled with Git
- [x] Deployed on GitHub pages.
- [] Implements responsive design principles.
- [x] Uses semantic HTML.

### Bonus (optional)

I did not include any optional features such as different styles for states or JavaScript elements.(Will do it in future)

- [ ] Different styles for active, hover and focus states.
- [ ] Include JavaScript to add some dynamic elements to your site. (Extra tricky!)

> - The different pages and features of your website on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes (multiple screenshots per page and screen size).
> - The different features of your site, e.g. if you have hover states, take a screenshot that shows that.
